# Awesome\_Energy\_LLM

This repository collects **papers**, **code**, and **resources** related to applying **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in the **energy domain**. The goal is to help researchers, engineers, and students stay up-to-date with recent advances, implementation practices, and emerging trends in this interdisciplinary field.

## üîç Scope

We focus on applications of LLMs in areas including but not limited to:

* **Load forecasting**
* **Energy optimization**
* **Smart grid and demand response**
* **Energy market analysis**
* **Energy policy and report analysis**
* **Natural language interface for energy systems**
* **Energy dataset summarization and annotation**
* **LLM-based data generation or augmentation for energy models**
